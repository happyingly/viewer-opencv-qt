This is a opencv project.

Core function: use camera to switch or rotate image with a hand

Other function: zoom in / zoom out / rotate / switch images
		make a screenshot

Main programming language: Qt and OpenCV


Alert: 1. This software is use English instead of Chinese. So it could make some 	happens.
       2. It just distinguishs skin, can't distinguish hand or face.
       3. I can't use multi-threads to process.

It is my graduate work, I learned OpenCV and Qt just one month, so it is very simple. 

I Hope I could improve it if someone would like to give me some suggestions.
